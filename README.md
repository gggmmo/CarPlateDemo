#  Car Plate Bluring Demo app

This is a demo project of bluring a car plate in Taiwan. It is using OpenCV (https://opencv.org/) for the car plate area detection.

## Environment
- Xcode 14.3.1
- iOS 16.4
- Swift 5.8.1
- OpenCV 4.8.0

## Tested in
- iPhone 14 pro Max (iOS 16.4)
- iPad mini (iOS 16.4)

## Building the project
To build the project, you need to download the OpenCV iOS pack from: https://opencv.org/releases/ and put the `opencv2.framework` under `CarPlateDemo\OpenCV\` directory.

## TODO
The accuracy of car plate recognition needs to be improved. Perhaps using AI model is a better way.
